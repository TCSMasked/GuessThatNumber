# GuessThatNumber - Open Source
The "GuessThatNumber" game is a simple and interactive Python game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, each with a different range of numbers. The player is given 10 lives (attempts) to guess the correct number. On each guess, the game provides clues to help the player narrow down the possible numbers. If the player guesses the correct number within the given lives, they win the game and are presented with a "YOU WIN" screen displaying the number of lives used and the actual number. If the player fails to guess the correct number within the given lives, a "GAME OVER" screen is displayed, revealing the generated number. The game provides an option to play again or exit. This project showcases the use of Python programming to create an entertaining and interactive game, implementing various game mechanics such as random number generation, user input validation, and providing clues to guide the player's guesses. The project emphasizes simplicity and user experience while offering different difficulty levels to cater to players of various skill levels.
